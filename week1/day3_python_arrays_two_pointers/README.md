# 🌀 Day 3 – Python Arrays & Two Pointers Challenges

---

## ⚔️ Challenge 6 – Two Sum II (LeetCode)

**🔗 Source:** [Two Sum II – LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

### 🧠 Problem Statement:
Given a sorted array of integers `numbers` and an integer `target`, return the 1-based indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

### 🚀 Solution Strategy:
- Use the two-pointer technique: start with one pointer at the beginning and one at the end.
- Move pointers inward based on the sum compared to the target.
- Return indices as soon as the pair is found.

### 📌 Key Concepts:
- Two-pointer technique for sorted arrays
- Efficient O(n) search for pairs
- 1-based index output

## ⚔️ Challenge 7 – Valid Palindrome (LeetCode)

**🔗 Source:** [Valid Palindrome – LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

### 🧠 Problem Statement:
Check if a string is a palindrome, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case.

### 🚀 Solution Strategy:
- Clean the string by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase.
- Use two pointers to compare characters from both ends.
- Return True if all pairs match, False otherwise.

### 📌 Key Concepts:
- String cleaning and normalization
- Two-pointer palindrome check
- Handling edge cases (empty string, punctuation)
